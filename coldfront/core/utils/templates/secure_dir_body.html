This document outlines the agreement between the Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) program and the PI named above (hereafter referred to as "the PI") for the use of P2/P3 data, as defined in the UC Berkeley Data Classification Standard, in the Savio High Performing Computing (HPC) system. The agreement is based upon a shared responsibility model for ensuring the security of the data, and compliance with the UC Berkeley Minimum Security Standard for Electronic Information policy and any associated Data Use Agreement (DUA). This agreement details the responsibilities of the PI, as well as any other researchers that are granted access by the PI to use the data in Savio. 
<br><br>Before use of P2/P3 data in Savio, Research IT staff will evaluate the data protection level of the data in question, which generally involves a review of relevant data use agreement (DUA) requirements to ensure Savio is in compliance. If Research IT staff deem it necessary, the evaluation will be escalated to Information Security & Policy (ISP) for a more formal data protection level assessment. If the data meet the requirements of the review and other approval requirements, the request for access may be granted. If the assessment reveals that the data are at the P4 level, Savio will not be allowed to be used for the research project. 
<br><br>The responsibilities are described in alignment with the Savio MSSEI PL1 Self-Assessment Plan; section numbers are references to that plan. In the text below, "Principal Investigator" and "PI" should be understood to be the project lead (generally the PI, and/or whoever signs the DUA), and "Researchers" includes all approved users in the group. 
<br><br>In addition to the researcher responsibilities described in this Agreement, researchers must be familiar with the Savio PL1 Incident Response Plan and the end-user requirements therein that are associated with responding to suspicious cybersecurity events. UC Berkeley's Information Security and Policy Incident Response Planning Guide, defines a suspicious event as:
<p style='margin-left: 80px;'>
An event that compromises or has the potential to compromise: the operation of covered core systems or confidentiality or integrity of covered data assets.
<br><br>A security incident may involve any or all of the following:
<ul style='margin-left: 80px;'><li>a violation of campus computer security policies and standards</li>
<li>unauthorized computer or data access</li>
<li>presence of a malicious application, such as a virus</li>
<li>presence of unexpected/unusual programs</li>
<li>a denial of service condition against data, network or computer</li>
<li>misuse of service, systems or information</li>
<li>physical or logical damage to systems</li>
<li>computer theft</li></ul></p>
<br>Researchers have access to a range of software that is managed by BRC staff, both in the base software image available on each node, as well as in the main shared modules collection. Researchers should prefer this software and these versions where this is practical; when using other software it is the researcher's responsibility to ensure that it will not compromise system security.
<h2>1.1 Removal of non-required covered data</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
Researchers are responsible for the removal of non-required covered data for their P2/P3 research projects. See 15.3 Secure deletion upon decommission and 15.4 Data Access Agreement for further details. 
<br><br>For data covered under the NIH guidelines for cloud providers, see also the document NIH Active Research workflow for NIH data for removing unencrypted data from scratch.
</p><h2>8.1 Privacy and Security Training</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
The PI for each P2/P3 project is responsible for ensuring that all users with access to the data in the Savio environment have completed required training in the use of the data, and in the use of the Savio infrastructure. All users with access should be familiar with the terms of this RUA.
</p><h2>9.1 Privacy and Security Training</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
All researchers with access to the Savio environment are bound by the terms of the campus Computer Use Policy (https://security.berkeley.edu/computer-use-policy), specifically including the management of strong passwords. Users may not share accounts, nor may they share passwords or other credentials. 
</p><h2>13.1 Controlled access based on need to know</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
Access to the Savio system is available to UC Berkeley principal investigators (PIs) and their associated researchers through the Faculty Computing Allowance (FCA) and Condo programs. Students may also gain access to the system through the Instructional Computing Allowance program. All users of the system must complete the BRC User Access Agreement form, and as such must accept and are subject to the Campus Computer Use Policy. All requests for access are reviewed by Research IT staff. 
<br><br>For access to covered P2/P3 data, researchers must submit a request to BRC/Savio administrators to add their user account to the file permissions for the group directory/folder where the P2/P3 data is stored. The request for access must be authorized by the PI (principal investigator) before being granted. BRC Savio administrators will verify the access request with the PI via email. 
<br><br>The Savio environment does not have an automated process to remove employees' access once they are no longer employed. However, by agreement and acceptance of our shared responsibility model for system security, Researchers must notify cluster administrators when a user is no longer a member of the project team using the covered system. 
<br><br>Research IT will conduct a semi-annual email-based confirmation of active users. Savio P2/P3 accounts of those who are no longer active users will be deactivated. 
<br><br>UC Berkeley PIs must vouch for users at other institutions, and they must let us know if/when a user is no longer with the institution. 
</p><h2>14.1 Account monitoring and management</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for monitoring account access to covered P2/P3 data within the Savio environment. The Savio team will provide PIs with Linux command line syntax for checking group directory permissions to verify which user accounts have access. The Savio team will also create a spreadsheet for the project, that will allow the PI to specify which users should be members of the group (i.e., which are allowed to have access to the resources). It is the responsibility of the PI to keep this spreadsheet current, and in particular, to remove users that should no longer have access. 
</p><h2>15.1 Encryption in transit</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
Researchers shall not use the DTN or other data transfer means to move any P2/P3 data in an unencrypted form. Researchers are responsible for training all users to ensure that unencrypted data is not transferred out of the Savio infrastructure, copied or moved onto personal or other devices.
</p><h2>15.2 Encryption on mobile devices and removable media </h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
Researchers must not download covered data to their personal laptop if it is not encrypted. Note also that campus policy requires that users not copy covered P2/P3 data to unencrypted mobile devices. Finally, note that if users download covered data onto any personal device, it is their sole responsibility to manage secure deletion of the data at the end of the project. (See also 15.3 Secure deletion upon decommission). 
<br><br>Note that covered P2/P3 data may not be stored in user directories in Savio. This policy ensures that covered data will not be included in UC Backup program, which avoids the potential for data to reside on unencrypted tape media, and simplifies the deletion of covered data at the end of a project. 
</p><h2>15.3 Secure deletion upon decommission</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
Researchers and PIs are responsible for secure deletion of covered P2/P3 data at the end of their research project. This includes both data on project storage areas, as well as in scratch<sup>1</sup>. 
<br><br>Project storage: All files on the project storage array should be deleted using normal file removal commands (e.g., rm). Inasmuch as all files on project storage must be encrypted, this will suffice. 
<br><br>Scratch (parallel filesystem) storage: All files (including in particular decrypted files and derivatives) must be deleted using a secure deletion utility such as shred. While users may choose to use the default number of passes (3), it is sufficient to run a single pass over the data; for large files this will significantly reduce the resources required to complete the secure deletion<sup>2</sup>. 
</p><h2>Additional NIH Security Best Practices for Controlled-Access Data Subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy ("NIH Data")</h2>
<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>
In addition to the campus security policy requirements listed above, Researchers working with NIH dbGaP data are responsible for the NIH security requirements detailed below. These requirements and guidelines refer to the NIH Security Best Practices document. See that original<sup>3</sup> for details. 
<br><ul style='margin-left: 40px'><li> Researchers working with NIH data must not post this data, or otherwise make it publicly available. BRC staff will not make any NIH data publicly available.
</li><li>NIH requires that approved users must retain the original version of the encrypted data, track all copies or extracts and ensure that the information is not divulged to anyone except authorized staff members at the institution. NIH therefore recommends ensuring careful control of physical copies of data and providing appropriate logging on machines where such data is resident. This is the responsibility of the P2/P3 project PI.
</li><li> As collaborating investigators from other institutions must submit an independent DAR and be approved by NIH to access to the data, restrict outbound access from devices that host controlled access data.
</li><li>Only those researchers specifically authorized in the NIH agreement are permitted access to covered data. Covered data must not be shared with other institutions; collaborators at other institutions must have their own data access request (DAR). Controlled data cannot be copied from the Savio environment to other institutions (or to storage accessible to other researchers) that are not governed by the original DAR.
</li><li>Investigators and Institutions may retain only encrypted copies of the minimum data necessary at their institution to comply with institutional scientific data retention policy and any data stored on temporary backup media as are required to maintain the integrity of the institution's data protection program. Ideally, the data will exist on backup media that is not used by other projects and can therefore be destroyed or erased without impacting other users/tenants. If retaining the data on separate backup media is not possible, as will be the case with many users, the media may be retained for the standard media retention period but may not be recovered for any purpose without a new Data Access Request approved by the NIH. Retained data should be deleted at the appropriate time, according to institutional policies. Note that no covered data may be stored in home directories, which are the only area in Savio on which BRC performs backups, and so this section applies to backups created by the PI and associated researchers; the PI is responsible for any backups generated.
</li><li>Encrypt data at rest with a user's own keys. SRA-toolkit includes this feature; other software providers offer tools to meet this requirement. The NIH Active Research workflow for NIH data in Savio describes requirements and responsibilities for deletion of unencrypted data when not in active use (i.e., at rest).
</li></ul></p><br>This agreement will cover all current and future datasets, throughout the period of time that the researcher (and designated collaborators) are utilizing the Research IT resources.
